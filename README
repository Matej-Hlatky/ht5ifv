The jQuery ht5ifv plugin is an extensible and highly configurable jquery plugin which 
allows validation of the HTML5's forms while the user is typing.

It is extensible because it allows the programmer to define new restrictions beyond
those already defined by HTML5.

It is highly configurable because not only does it allow changes to the validation 
rules defined by HTML5, but also the addition of new ones.

Moreover, although assuming, by default, behaviors and ways to flag the errors in a 
very intuitive manner, it also provides the developer with complete freedom to redefine 
or even suppress them.
